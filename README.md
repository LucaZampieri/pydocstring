Python package for autogenerating python docstrings

The Idea is that this project can be wrapped by an editor extension to provide in-editor docstrings.

Development state: In progress, don't bother to attempt using it yet

Why not just use `ast` and parse the file? This aims to be a cross-version docstring creator

Hopefully I don't need to write a full python parser
