# pydocstring

Python package for autogenerating python docstrings

[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robodair/pydocstring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robodair/pydocstring)

The idea is that this project can be wrapped by an editor extension to provide in-editor docstrings.

## Development state:
Initial development nearly there

## TODO:

- Autocompletion of docstrings for classes
- Commandline entry point

Why not just use `ast` and parse the file? This aims to be a cross-version docstring creator

Hopefully I don't need to write a full python parser
