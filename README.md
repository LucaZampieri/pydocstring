# pydocstring
[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robodair/pydocstring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robodair/pydocstring)
Python package for autogenerating python docstrings, and switching between common docstring formats


Development state: In progress, don't bother to attempt using it yet

Why not just use `ast` and parse the file? This aims to be a cross-version docstring creator
Hopefully I don't need to write a fully python parser
